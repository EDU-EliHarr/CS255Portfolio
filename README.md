Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project aimed to develop a system for a new company focused on improving driving test success rates. The client, DriverPass, sought a comprehensive system for online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training management.

What did you do particularly well?

Based on the feedback I recivved from my instructor and peers, I did particularly well at describing the designed system to a non-technical audience. I avoided technical language, and was able to describe the system using use case examples of what each of the different user

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the activity diagram for logging in, by adding logic to limit the number of attempts the user gets for entering a password. I would update the use case diagram to allign the roles listed with the interview transcription, by adding the secreatarty and admin roles.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I reviewed the interview transcription, and as I read through it, I was taking notes whenever someone said they wanted to do something with the software. I'd note who it was and what they wanted to do. This formed a user story that helped me collect requirements of the system. User needs are vital as they ensure the system is practical, meets expectations, and is user-friendly.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When approaching software design, I prioritize understanding the user's needs and the problem the software intends to solve. Moving forward I plan on utilizing UML diagrams, such as use case, activity, and class diagrams, to visually represent and analyze the system's structure and behavior.
